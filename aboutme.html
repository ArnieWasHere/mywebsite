			<h2>About</h2><p><b>Picture this: sunny Los Angeles, California, where my journey into the world of creativity began. From a young age, I was drawn to the allure of video editing, graphic design, and animation – crafting vibrant designs and diving into imaginative games that ignited my creative spark.
			But it wasn't just pixels and colors that captivated me. <br><br></p>
			<p><b>High school brought a new adventure as I stepped onto the volleyball court, feeling the rush of freedom with each serve and spike. With grit and determination, I quickly mastered the game, conjuring up strategic plays that earned me the titles of second state defender and MVP – not bad for a rookie, right?<br><br></p>
			<p>Yet amidst the adrenaline and victories, I found myself cherishing the moments of levity and laughter shared with my teammates. It was in those light-hearted exchanges that a brilliant idea struck – why not merge my passion for the arts with my love for volleyball? And so, here I am today, a creative whirlwind on and off the court, ready to continue my journey of crafting captivating content and making waves in the world of volleyball and beyond. Let's keep the creativity flowing!</p>
